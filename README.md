# Information Security

A place where I can create, collect and share tooling, resources and knowledge about information security.

Go check out the [wiki](https://github.com/JakobRPennington/InformationSecurity/wiki) for my notes, cheatsheets and resources.

## Contributing

Pull requests are totally welcomed and appreciated!

## Resources

Thes repository contains a mix things that I have created as well as a curation of other people's work. I owe it to these people for creating things that I use every day, so the least I can do is give credit and forward others on to their work.
